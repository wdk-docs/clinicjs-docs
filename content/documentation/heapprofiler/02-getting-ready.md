# Getting ready

Once we've installed `clinic` and verified that `clinic heapprofiler` is functioning
we can profile an application.

To try this out, let's clone and prepare the official Clinic.js Heap Profiler demo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clinicjs/node-clinic-heap-profiler-demo.git
cd node-clinic-heap-profiler-demo
npm install
```

While npm downloads the dependencies, check the [Readme](https://github.com/clinicjs/node-clinic-heap-profiler-demo),
then we are ready to profile!
