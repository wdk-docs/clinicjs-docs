# 准备

Great, now we are ready to start profiling. To start profiling we find need a server of some sorts that does some async operations to get started. To keep things simple let's use our "official" Bubbleprof example that evolves around optimising a server that queries a mongodb containing npm metadata data.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clinicjs/node-clinic-bubbleprof-demo.git
```

If you read the example README, it will contain some instructions on how to get mongodb setup with npm data and more.
