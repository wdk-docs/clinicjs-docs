# Getting ready

We need some example applications to use Doctor on. The repo
[`node-clinic-doctor-examples`](https://github.com/clinicjs/node-clinic-doctor-examples)
contains several for us to explore. Let's run the following to clone the repository
and install its dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nearform/node-clinic-doctor-examples.git
cd node-clinic-doctor-examples
npm install
```

The [README](https://github.com/clinicjs/node-clinic-doctor-examples) contains some
general information, which can be read while the install completes.
