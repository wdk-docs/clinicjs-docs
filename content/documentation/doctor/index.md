# Doctor

Symptoms such as low CPU usage, blocking garbage collection, frequent event loop delay or a chaotic number of active handles may indicate a number of potential problems. Doctor helps narrow down the possibilities by generating a recommendation based on those symptoms. Examples such as I/O issues, non-optimized garbage collection and blocked event loop are quite common. Doctor will help you with all of these.
